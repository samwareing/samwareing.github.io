Responsible for stakeholder management with international clients, leading team meetings, and delivering presentations to the company at large.",
        "Spearheaded the release of Webclient to global customers, via Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Redesigned the system into a cloud-native microservice architecture, building a new high performance service in Go with Kafka. Write throughput was improved by over 5 orders of magnitude - allowing the company to achieve real-time data analytics, scaling up from 3 to 100s of fermentors, whilst simultaneously reducing occurrences of data loss to zero, and saving over £10,000 per month on cloud costs."
